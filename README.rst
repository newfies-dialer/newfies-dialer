Newfies-Dialer is a free and open source voice broadcast application, which
can fulfill a variety of roles for a range of industries and organisations who
wish to contact large numbers of people by phone in a short space of time.

The Newfies-Dialer aplication has been built using a messaging system so that
it can support distributed processing on cloud servers. The platform is
focused on real-time operations and task call distributions to clustered
brokers and workers meaning that many millions of calls can be processed daily.

Newfies-Dialer can be installed on a standalone server for smaller deployments.
It currently utilises the Freeswitch Telephony engine
(http://www.freeswitch.org) to process the the outbound calls. However support
for other telephony engines, such as Asterisk may be added in the future.

Newfies-Dialer is written in Lua & Python using the Django Framework, and operates with
message brokers such as RabbitMQ.

In order to communicate with external systems, Newfies-Dialer has been
released with a substantial set of API's to easily integrate the platform
with third-party applications.

Newfies-Dialer is supplied with a comprehensive administrative and user
interface which allows you and your customers to create outbound call
campaigns, add phonebooks, subscribers, as well as record audio messages
and design more complex IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications.
When ready and tested, the campaign can be launched from the interface.
